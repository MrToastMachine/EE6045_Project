Repo for EE6045 MATLAB Project modelling SAR ADC

## Notes 

### written from github (Wed 20th March):
The resistor mismatch is of constant scale because all resistors are equal. The percentage for each will amount to the same.

The capacitor mismatch will have to scale according to the capacitor value becasause they will be different values. The capacitors
are binary weighted

- could use this array already created. its called something like __weighted__ or __weights__ or something that has the scalings needed
